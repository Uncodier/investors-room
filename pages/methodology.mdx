## üéØ North Star Metrics

### Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)

**Definition:** Total value of recurring subscription revenue normalized to a one-year period.

**Calculation:**
```
ARR = (Monthly Recurring Revenue √ó 12) + Annual Contracts
```

**Components:**
- **New ARR**: Revenue from new customers acquired in the period
- **Expansion ARR**: Additional revenue from existing customers (upgrades, add-ons)
- **Contraction ARR**: Revenue lost from existing customers (downgrades)
- **Churned ARR**: Revenue lost from customers who canceled

**Reporting Rules:**
- Only recurring subscription revenue counts (excludes one-time setup fees)
- Annual contracts are included at full value when signed
- Multi-year contracts are included at the annual amount, not total contract value
- ARR is calculated at the end of each month/quarter

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Definition:** Total sales and marketing expenses required to acquire one new customer.

**Calculation:**
```
CAC = (Sales & Marketing Expenses) √∑ Number of New Customers Acquired
```

**Time Period:** Calculated monthly and aggregated quarterly

**Included Expenses:**
- Sales team salaries and commissions
- Marketing spend (ads, content, events)
- Marketing team salaries
- Sales tools and software
- Allocated portion of overhead costs

**Excluded:**
- Customer success costs

- Viewing analytics dashboard
- Creating or modifying workflows
- Using mobile app for sales activities

**Calculation Period:** Calendar month (1st to last day)

**Segmentation:**
- By user type (admin, sales rep, manager)
- By customer segment (Enterprise, Mid-Market, SMB)
- By product usage level (power user, regular, casual)

### Net Promoter Score (NPS)

**Definition:** Measures customer satisfaction and likelihood to recommend our product.

**Calculation:**
```
NPS = % Promoters (9-10) - % Detractors (0-6)
```

**Survey Methodology:**
- Quarterly email surveys to all active users
- Single question: "How likely are you to recommend Market Fit to a colleague?" (0-10 scale)
- Follow-up open-ended question for feedback
- Minimum 30% response rate required for statistical significance

### Feature Adoption Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of active customers using a specific feature.

**Calculation:**
```
Adoption Rate = (Customers Using Feature √∑ Total Active Customers) √ó 100
```

**Measurement Criteria:**
- Must use feature at least once per month to count as "adopted"
- Tracked separately for each customer segment
- New features measured from launch date + 30 days

## üí∞ Financial Metrics

### Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

**Definition:** Predictable monthly revenue from all active subscriptions.

**Calculation Components:**
- **New MRR**: From new customers in the month
- **Expansion MRR**: From upgrades and add-ons
- **Contraction MRR**: From downgrades
- **Churned MRR**: From canceled subscriptions

**Recognition Rules:**
- Revenue recognized when service is delivered
- Prorated for mid-month starts/cancellations
- Annual subscriptions divided by 12
- Usage-based revenue excluded from MRR

### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

**Definition:** Measures revenue growth from existing customers over time.

**Calculation:**
```
NRR = (Starting MRR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) √∑ Starting MRR
```

**Cohort Methodology:**
- Measured over 12-month periods
- Cohorts defined by customer acquisition month
- Only includes customers with >90 days tenure
- Excludes customers who churned within first 90 days

### Gross Margin

**Definition:** Percentage of revenue remaining after direct costs of service delivery.

**Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Includes:**
- Cloud infrastructure costs (AWS, Vercel, etc.)
- Third-party AI/ML service costs
- Customer support team costs
- Data processing and storage costs
- Payment processing fees

**Excluded from COGS:**
- Sales and marketing expenses

- General administrative expenses
- Depreciation of equipment

## üìà Customer Success Metrics

### Customer Churn Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of customers who cancel their subscription in a given period.

**Calculation:**
```
Monthly Churn Rate = (Customers Lost in Month √∑ Customers at Start of Month) √ó 100
```

**Methodology:**
- Calculated monthly and aggregated to quarterly
- Customer counted as churned on cancellation date
- Voluntary and involuntary churn tracked separately
- Segmented by customer size and acquisition channel

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Definition:** Predicted total revenue from a customer over their entire relationship.

**Calculation:**
```
LTV = (Average Revenue per Customer √∑ Monthly Churn Rate) √ó Gross Margin %
```

- Includes expansion revenue in calculations
- Gross margin applied to account for service costs
- Updated quarterly with latest churn data

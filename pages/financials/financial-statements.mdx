    <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclosure:</strong> Market Fit underwent a strategic pivot in late 2024, transitioning from our previous business model to focus on building AI-powered virtual sales employees. As a result, operations were temporarily paused during Q4 2024 to reallocate resources and restructure the company for this new direction. The financial statements presented reflect the company's position during this transitional period, with minimal revenue generation and reduced operational activity. The substantial digital infrastructure assets ($610,542) position us strongly for the relaunch in 2025, providing runway without significant infrastructure costs.

Market Fit maintains comprehensive financial records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, demonstrating our commitment to transparency and fiscal responsibility during this strategic transformation.

## Notes to Financial Statements

### 1. Basis of Preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) on an accrual basis. All amounts are presented in United States Dollars (USD), with foreign currency transactions converted at the rate of 19.96 MXN/USD.

### 2. Significant Accounting Policies

#### Revenue Recognition
Revenue from software leasing is recognized on a monthly basis as services are delivered to customers. The company follows a subscription-based model with revenue recognized ratably over the service period. Note that revenue shown represents pre-pivot operations.

#### Digital Infrastructure Assets
Cloud infrastructure credits are recorded at fair market value and classified as prepaid assets. These credits represent committed cloud computing resources from major providers and are consumed as services are utilized. Management has verified these credits remain valid and available for the new platform.

#### Foreign Currency Translation
Transactions denominated in Mexican Pesos are translated to USD at the prevailing exchange rate at the time of the transaction. The exchange rate applied for the period is 19.96 MXN/USD.

### 3. Going Concern
The company has recorded a net loss of $6,607.54 for the month ended September 30, 2024, which is expected during the strategic pivot period. Management believes the substantial digital infrastructure assets of $610,542 provide sufficient resources to continue operations without requiring significant cash expenditure. Additionally, pending capital contributions of $214,289.20 are expected to be converted to equity, strengthening the company's financial position. The company expects to resume revenue generation in Q1 2025 with the launch of the new AI-powered platform.

### 4. Strategic Pivot Disclosure
In Q4 2024, the company made the strategic decision to pivot from its previous business model to focus exclusively on AI-powered virtual sales employees. This transition required:
- Pausing active operations to preserve capital
- Retaining only core team members essential for the new platform
- Securing strategic digital infrastructure assets
- Restructuring the company for the new business model

## Management Commentary

### Strategic Transformation
Market Fit is undergoing a fundamental transformation from our legacy business to become a leader in AI-powered virtual sales employees. The financial statements reflect this transitional period, with intentionally reduced operations to preserve resources for the relaunch.

### Financial Position
Despite the operational pause, Market Fit maintains a strong asset base of $641,857.89, predominantly consisting of valuable digital infrastructure credits. These assets provide a significant competitive advantage by eliminating infrastructure costs for an extended period, allowing us to focus capital on product development and market expansion.

### Revenue Growth Strategy
Management is focused on launching the new AI platform in Q1 2025, with targets to achieve $50,000 MRR by Q2 2025 and break-even operations by Q3 2025. The substantial infrastructure assets provide the runway needed to scale without dilutive funding requirements.

### Capital Structure
The pending capital contributions of $214,289.20 represent committed funding from the founder that will strengthen the company's equity position upon conversion. This capital, combined with the digital asset portfolio and expected collections from legacy operations, positions the company for sustainable growth without immediate external funding needs.
